# Library-Management-System-Java(OOP)

# Overview

This repository contains a group academic project developed as part of an Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.
The project implements a simple Library Management System using Java, focusing on applying core OOP principles and class design.

# Features

- Manage different library assets (physical books and audiobooks)
- Store book information such as title, author, and availability
- Handle customer borrowing sessions
- Book checkout functionality
- Support for discussion rooms
- Menu-based interaction through a main program

# Object-Oriented Concepts Applied

- Classes and Objects to model library entities
- Inheritance (e.g., PhysicalBook and AudioBook extending Book)
- Encapsulation for managing data and behavior
- Polymorphism in handling different library assets
- Separation of responsibilities across multiple classes

# Technologies Used

-Java
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# IMPORTANT NOTE
